# React Native: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')` and provides a solution.

This error typically occurs when a component attempts to access a property of an object that is `null` or `undefined`. This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations (e.g., data fetching) before the data is loaded.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains a React component that attempts to render data before it has been fetched and processed.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version of the component using optional chaining or conditional rendering to handle the potential `null` or `undefined` values gracefully.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`)
