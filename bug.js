This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It often arises when dealing with asynchronous operations where the data hasn't loaded yet, resulting in an attempt to access a property of `null` or `undefined`.

```javascript
// Example: Trying to access a property before data is fetched

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* This will throw the error if data is still null */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
